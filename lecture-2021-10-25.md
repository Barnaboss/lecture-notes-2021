* Reading for this session: until end of chapter 1

* Review of AST, pattern matching, and structural recursion using the
  code in Figure 1.3

* Discussion of interpreter for Lint (Figure 1.4)

  * structure (module, statement, expression) imposed by Python

  * `interp_exp (e)` returns the value of expression `e`

  * `interp_stmt (s)` executes the statement `s`; generally, a
    statement does not return a value

  * `interp_Lint(p)` executes the statements in the module's body

* Discussion of diagram (1.7) - correctness criterion for a compiler

  * compile : L1 --> L2

  * P2 = compile (P1)

  * compile is correct if, for all P1 \in L1 and inputs i, the
	compiled program generates the same output as P1:
	interpL1 (P1, i) == interpL2 (compile (P1), i)

* Discussion of partial evaluator for Lint programs

  * peLint : Lint --> Lint

  * idea: all subexpressions of peLint(P) should be evaluated as much
    as possible

  * that is, the output of peLint(P) should not contain expressions of
  the form

    * `BinOp (Constant (x), Add(), Constant (y))`
    * `UnaryOp (USub(), Constant (x))`

  * the code in Fig 1.5 achieves just that in the functions `pe_neg`
    and `pe_add`

  * example and statement of first assignment

```
ex3 = "print(input_int() + (2 + 3))"
ex3_from_book = "print(input_int() + 5)"

ex4 = "print((input_int() + 2) + 3)"
ex4_from_book = "print((input_int() + 2) + 3)"
ex4_your_pe   = "print(input_int() + 5)"
```

   The peLint from the book optimizes `ex3`, but not `ex4`. It's your
   task to improve `peLint` to translate `ex4` into the last line.

# Chapter 2

## The language Lvar

* adds variabless to expressions and assignment to statements

* discussed the extensions needed in concrete and abstract syntax

* approch to organize interpreters so that they are extensible

  * each language corresponds to a class

  * methods of the class interpret expressions, statements etc

  * a subclass can override interpretation to define the new cases of
    the abstract syntax and fall back to the previous implementation
    by invoking the corresponding interpretation in the super
    class. Recursive calls *return* to the original class.

  * First, we need to extend the interpreter for Lint with an
    environment to hold the bindings of the variables.

  * The subclass for Lvar implements variable references and
    assignment by recourse to the environment.

  * In Fig 2.4 we found the following code snippet:

```
    case Assign([lhs], value):
        env[lhs.id] = self.interp_exp(value, env)
	    return self.interp_stmts(ss[1:], env)
```

is identical to

```
    case Assign([Name(id)], value):
        env[id] = self.interp_exp(value, env)
	    return self.interp_stmts(ss[1:], env)
```
