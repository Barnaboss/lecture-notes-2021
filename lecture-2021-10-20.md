# Welcome to Compiler Construction!

## What's a compiler?

## Essentials of Compilation

## Assignments, Exams, Grading, Academic Integrity

* Assignments: bi-weekly, voluntary

* Exam: take home, topic: extend the compiler with new features,
code base either from assignments or provided by the instructors,
documentation must be provided

* Grading: 80% extensional based on test cases passed, 20% code
review

* two days of work, distributed over two weeks (ie. tasks will
  available two weeks before the deadline = exam date in HisInOne)

## Technology

* Web page:
  https://proglang.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/compilerbau/2021ws/

* Forum: in Ilias https://ilias.uni-freiburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_2389688&client_id=unifreiburg

* Lecture video:
  Zoom Meeting ID 6931110826  https://uni-freiburg.zoom.us/j/69311108026?pwd=aDlHczZxTnFHdFBXb0ZiZ1NueGxmQT09

* GitHub repository for lecture notes, assignment submission, starter code, etc
  https://github.com/Compiler-Construction-Uni-Freiburg

* GitHub  Classroom for submission of assignments and exam solutions
  * to participate you need to obtain a GitHub account
  * we assign a fresh identifier to everyone registered in the Ilias course
  * the GitHub classroom only knows the identifiers
  * when using it the first time, you connect the identifier to the GitHub you're current logged into

### What to do when technology fails

* Zoom fails during lecture: recordings will be available
* Technology glitches will not impact grades
* The final exam will be spread over several days; late submissions will be allowed for a grade penalty of 10%.

## Concrete Syntax, Abstract Syntax Trees, Python AST Structures

### Programs in concrete syntax in Lint and in ASTs

```python
42

input_int()

-10

-10 + 5

input_int() + (- input_int())
```


### Python (data) classes

```python
@dataclass
class Add:
  pass

@dataclass
class Constant:
  value : int

@dataclass
class BinOp:
  left : any
  op : Add
  right : any
```

## Grammars

### Concrete syntax

```
exp  ::= int | input_int() | - exp | exp + exp | (exp)
stmt ::= print(exp) | exp
Lint ::= stmt*
```

### Abstract syntax (Python module `ast`)

```        
exp  ::= Const(int)
         | Call(Name(’input_int’),[])
         | UnaryOp(USub(),exp)
         | BinOp (exp, Add(), exp)
stmt ::= Expr(Call(Name(’print’),[exp])) | Expr(exp)
Lint ::= Module (stmt*)
```
